# Lab: Repeats with cycles - For-cycle


####  Numbers from 1 to 100

	Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, each on a new line.
	
*Sample input and output*

| Input  | Output |
| :----  | :----- |
| (none) | 1      |
| 	 | 2      |
| 	 | 3      |
| 	 | …      |
| 	 | 98     |
| 	 | 99     |
| 	 | 100    |

*Guidelines*

	⦁ Create a new file named "numbers1To100".
	⦁ Go to the function body and write the solution to the problem.
 
#### Numbers from N to 1 in reverse order

	Write a function that takes a positive number n entered by the user and prints the numbers n to 1 in reverse order.
	The number n entered will always be greater than 1.
	
*Sample input and output*

| Input   | Output |
| :----   | :----- |
| ["2"])  | 2      |
| 	  | 1      |
|         |        |
| (["3"]) | 3      |
| 	  | 2      |
| 	  | 1      |
|         |        |
| (["5"]) | 5      |
| 	  | 4      |
|         | 3      |
|         | 2      |
|         | 1      |

*Guidelines*

	⦁ Convert the given string number to a numeric type.
	⦁ Make a for loop from n to 0, but instead of increasing the variable i by 1, decrease it by 1 at each iteration of the loop:
	⦁ In the body of the loop, print the variable i.
 
#### Numbers from 1 to N through 3
 
	Write a function that gets a number n and prints the numbers from 1 to n through 3.
	
*Sample input and output*

| Input    | Output  |
| :----    | :-----  |
| (["10"]) | 1       |
| 	   | 4       |
|          | 7       |
| 	   | 10      |
|          |         |
| (["7"])  | 1       |
|          | 4       |
| 	   | 7       |
|          |         |
| (["15"]) | 1       |
|          | 4       |
|          | 7       |
|          | 10      |
|          | 13      |

*Guidelines*

	⦁ Make a for loop from 1 to n (inclusive) and set step 3. 
 	This means that at each iteration of the loop, the variable i will increase its value by 3 instead of 1:
 	In the body of the loop, print the variable i.
 
 
#### Even powers of 2

 	Write a function that gets a number n and prints the even powers of 2 ≤ 2n.

*Sample input and output*

| 	   | 4       |
|          |         |
| (["4"])  | 1       |
| 	   | 4       |
|          | 16      |
|          |         |
| (["5"])  | 1       |
|          | 4       |
|          |         |
| (["6"]   | 1       |
|          | 4       |
|          | 16      |
|          | 64      |


#### Flow of symbols

	Write a function that receives text (string) and prints each character of the text on a separate line.
	
*Sample input and output*

| Input           | Output |
| :----           | :----- |
| (["softuni"])	  | s      |
| 	          | o      |
|                 | f      |
|                 | t      |
| 	          | u      |
|                 | n      |
|                 | i      |
|                 |        |

|                 | a      |
|                 | m      |

*Guidelines*

	⦁ Make a for loop with the initial value of the control variable from 0 to input.length (the length of the text).
	  At each iteration, take the position letter in the input word equal to the value of the control variable i, by []
	⦁ At each iteration, print the value of the variable letter.
 
#### Summation of vowel letters

	Write a function that gets, calculates and prints the sum of the vowel values according to the table below.

| (["hi"])     | 3	| i = 3                     |
| (["bamboo"]) | 9	| a + o + o = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 |
| (["beer"])   | 4	| e + e = 2 + 2 = 4         |
