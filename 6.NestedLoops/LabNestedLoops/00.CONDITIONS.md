# Lab: Nested loops

### Clock

	Write a function that prints the hours of the day from 0: 0 to 23:59, each on a separate line.
	The hours must be displayed in the format "{hour}: {minutes}".

*Sample input and output*

| Input  |	Output |
| :---   | :---   |
| (none) | 0:0    |
|        | 0:1    |
|        | 0:2    |
|        | 0:3    |
|        | 0:4    |
|        | 0:5    |
|        | 0:6    |
|        | 0:7    |
|        | 0:8    |
|        | 0:9    |
|        | 0:10   |
|        | ...    |
|        | 23:50  |
|        | 23:51  |
|        | 23:52  |
|        | 23:53  |
|        | 23:54  |
|        | 23:55  |
|        | 23:56  |
|        | 23:57  |
|        | 23:58  |
|        | 23:59  |

*Guidelines*

	⦁ Create 2 nested for-cycles to iterate every minute and hour of the day:
	⦁ Print the result.
	
	
### Multiplication table

	  Print on the console the multiplication table for the numbers 1 to 10 in the format:
	  "{first multiplier} * {second multiplier} = {result}". 
	
*Sample input and output*

| Input  | Output |
| :---   | :---   |
| (none) | 1 * 1 = 1 |
|        | 1 * 2 = 2 |
|        | 1 * 3 = 3 |
|        | 1 * 4 = 4 |
|        | 1 * 5 = 5 |
|        | 1 * 6 = 6 |
|        | 1 * 7 = 7 |
|        | 1 * 8 = 8 |
|        | 1 * 9 = 9 |
|        | 1 * 10 = 10 |
|        | ... |
|        | 10 * 1 = 10 |
|        | 10 * 2 = 20 |
|        | 10 * 3 = 30 |
|        | 10 * 4 = 40 |
|        | 10 * 5 = 50 |
|        | 10 * 6 = 60 |
|        | 10 * 7 = 70 |
|        | 10 * 8 = 80 |
|        | 10 * 9 = 90 |
|        | 10 * 10 = 100 |

*Guidelines*

	⦁ Create 2 nested for-cycles to iterate over every possible value of the two multipliers from 1 to 10.
	⦁ Find the product of the two factors and print the result.
	
	
### Combinations

	Write a function that calculates how many solutions in natural numbers (including zero) the equation has:
	x1 + x2 + x3 = n
	The number n is an integer and is entered by the console.
	
*Sample input and output*

|Input | Output | Explanations |
| :---| :----  | :----        |
| (["25"]) | 351 | We generate all combinations of 3 numbers, the first is: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, but because it is not equal to 25, we continue: 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 - also not 25, etc. We come to the first valid combination: 0 + 0 + 25 = 25, we increase the number of valid combinations by 1, the second valid combination is: 0 + 1 + 24 = 25. The third: 0 + 2 + 23 = 25, etc. After generating all possible combinations, the number of valid ones is 351.|
| (["20"]) | 231 | |
| (["5"])  | 21  | |

*Guidelines*

	⦁ Create 3 nested for-cycles to iterate every possible value of one of the 3 numbers in the equation.
	⦁ Check the innermost input cycle for the values of x1, x2, x3 in each iteration.
	  For the equation to be valid, their sum must be equal to n. Create a validCombinationsCount variable,
	  which keeps the number of valid combinations and add to it every time you generate one.
	⦁ Finally, print the number of valid combinations (validCombinationsCount).
	
	
### Sum of two numbers

	Write a function that checks all possible combinations of a pair of numbers in the interval of two given numbers.
	The output is printed, which is the first combination, the sum of the numbers of which is equal to a given magic 
	number. If there is no combination that matches the condition, a message is printed that it was not found.
	Input
	The function receives an array of 3 elements:
	⦁ First - beginning of the interval - integer in the interval [1 ... 999]
	⦁ Second - end of the interval - integer in the interval [greater than the first number ... 1000]
	⦁ Third - the magic number - an integer in the interval [1 ... 10000]
	Exit
	One line should be printed on the console, according to the result:
	⦁ In the first combination found, the sum of the numbers of which is equal to the magic number:
	⦁ "Combination N: {sequence number} ({first number} + {second number} = {magic number})"
	⦁ If no matching condition is found:
	} "{Number of all combinations} combinations - neither equals {magic number}"

*Sample input and output*

|Input | Output | Explanations |
| :--- | :----  | :----        |
| (["1","10","5"]) | Combination N:4 (1 + 4 = 5) | All combinations of two numbers between 1 and 10 are: 1 1, 1 2, 1 3, 1 4, 1 5, ... 2 1, 2 2, ... 4 9, 4 10, 5 1 ... 10 9, 10 10. The first combination whose sum of numbers is equal to the magic number 5 is the fourth (1 and 4) |
| (["88","888","1000"])	| Combination N:20025 (112 + 888 = 1000) | |
| (["23","24","20"]) | 4 combinations - neither equals 20 | All combinations of two numbers between 23 and 24 are: 23 23, 23 24, 24 23, 24 24 (4 in total). There are no pairs of numbers whose sum is equal to the magic 20 |
| (["88", "888", "2000"]) | 641601 combinations - neither equals 2000 | |


### Travel

	Annie loves to travel and wants to visit several different destinations this year. When she chooses a destination,
	she will decide how much money she will need to get there and start saving. When she has saved enough, she will 
	be able to travel.The function receives an array, and each time the destination and the minimum budget that will
	be needed for the trip will be read.Then you will read a few sums that Annie saves by working and when she manages 
	to collect enough for the trip, she will leave, and the console should show:
	"Going to {destination}!"
	When she has visited all the destinations she wants, instead of a destination she will enter "End" and the program will end.
	
*Sample input and output*

| Input	| Output |
| :---- | :----- |
| (["Greece","1000","200","200","300","100","150","240","Spain","1200","300","500","193","423","End"]) | Going to Greece! Going to Spain!	|
| (["France","2000","300","300","200","400","190","258","360","Portugal","1450","400","400","200","300","300", |
| "Egypt","1900","1000","280","300","500","End"]) | Going to France! Going to Portugal! Going to Egypt! |

### Building

	Write a function that displays the numbers of the rooms in a building (in descending order) on the console, 
	provided that the following conditions are met:
	⦁ There are only offices on each even floor
	⦁ There are only apartments on each odd floor
	⦁ Each apartment is marked as follows: A {floor number} {apartment number}, apartment numbers start from 0.
	⦁ Each office is denoted as follows: О {floor number} {office number}, office numbers also start from 0.
	⦁ There are always apartments on the top floor and they are bigger than the others, so in front of their
	  number it says 'L' instead of 'A'. If there is only one floor, there are only large apartments!
	The function receives an array of two integers - the number of floors and the number of rooms per floor.
